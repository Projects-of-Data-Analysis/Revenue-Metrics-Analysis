        Commentary
    </h2>
    <p>
        All the work in this section was performed in a Python (Jupyter Notebook) environment.<br><br>
        Upon examining the obtained data, it was observed that the <code>payment_date</code> data in the <code>users_payment.csv</code> file was not defined as a date but instead as a string.<br><br>
        Furthermore, while metrics such as MRR, Paid Users, ARPPU, New Paid Users, and New MRR can be calculated with the available information, it was determined that calculating metrics like Churn Users, Churn Rate, Expansion MRR, and Contraction MRR requires preprocessing.<br><br>
        In this context, the operations performed are explained step by step and Jupyter Notebook file used for this section can be found

            The <code>payment_date</code> data provided in the database was given as a string in the YYYY-MM-DD format and was converted to a datetime format in the previous step. Since the calculations in this study will be performed on a monthly basis, all date data has been transformed to the first day of the month, and the resulting new data has been saved in a column named.

        <p>
            Upon examining the dataset, it was determined that users made payments in some months, made a single payment in some months, and made multiple payments in others. To standardize users with multiple payments, the <code>payment_month</code> data was created in a previous step. To calculate metrics such as missing payment data (e.g., churn, etc.), a calendar was created spanning from the first payment date to the last payment date in the dataset.
