        Commentary
    </h2>
    <p>
        All operations here were performed using DBeaver in PostgreSQL.<br><br>
        Upon examining the obtained data, it was observed that the <code>payment_date</code> data in the <code>users_payment.csv</code> file was not defined as a date but instead as a string.<br><br>
        Furthermore, while metrics such as MRR, Paid Users, ARPPU, New Paid Users, and New MRR can be calculated with the available information, it was determined that calculating metrics like Churn Users, Churn Rate, Expansion MRR, and Contraction MRR requires preprocessing.<br><br>
        In this context, the operations performed are explained step by step and SQL script file used for this section can be found
