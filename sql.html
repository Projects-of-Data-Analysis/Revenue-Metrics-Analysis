        In this section, calculations were performed based on the metrics specified above using the relevant databases, and the results obtined were interpreted and visualized. A database has been created in MySQL Lite, and the CSV file obtained from the previous study has been uploaded there, with operations performed in this environment, and the SQL script file used for this section can be found

            Upon evaluating the obtained results, it is observed that there is a significant increase in MRR from January to December. This increase was more pronounced in the early months of the year, while a slight decrease was noted in the later months.

            Upon examining the obtained results, it was observed that, similar to the previous query, the number of new users increased by nearly 4.5 times from the beginning to the end of the year. However, while a rapid increase in user numbers was seen in the early months of the year, a slight decrease was noted toward the later months.
