                <strong>New MRR:</strong> The MRR generated by newly acquired paying users in a given month.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Churned Users:</strong> The number of users who stopped paying during the specified period.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Churn Rate</strong>: The ratio of churned users during a specific period to the number of
                paid users in the previous period (calendar month).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Churned Revenue:</strong> The total revenue lost from users who churned, based on their
                payments from the previous period.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Revenue Churn Rate:</strong> The percentage of revenue lost due to churned users in a given
                month, relative to the total revenue from those users in the previous month.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Expansion MRR:</strong> The increase in MRR from one month to the next, generated by existing
                users who started paying more.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Contraction MRR:</strong> The decrease in MRR from one month to the next, due to existing
                users paying less than they did previously.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <br>
        <p>The study was conducted in two main phases. The first phase involved cleaning and organizing the data in a
            Python environment to calculate the determined metrics. The second phase involved the calculation of the
            metrics, which was carried out in three sub-phases. First, calculations were performed in an SQL
            environment. Second, calculations were conducted in a Python environment. Finally, using Tableau, the
            necessary calculations were made, and the results were visualized.</p>
