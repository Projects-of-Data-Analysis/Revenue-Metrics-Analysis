    <section class="intro">
        <p>Based on data obtained from a company operating in the gaming industry, this study aims to analyze the
            company’s cash flows.<br>
            <br>
            This process will be carried out in three stages. First, various queries will be performed in PostgreSQL
            to examine the values of different metrics and to gain a full understanding of the data. In the second
            stage, the data will be evaluated based on predefined metrics in a Python environment, and visualizations
            will be created. In the final stage, the results will be visualized in Tableau, and a dashboard will be
            developed.
